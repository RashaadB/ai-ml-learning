## Sales Analysis

1. Data wrangling

Ensure that the data is clean and free from any missing or incorrect entries.
Inspect the data manually to identify missing or incorrect information using the functions isna() and notna().
Based on your knowledge of data analytics, include your recommendations for treating missing and incorrect data (dropping the null values or filling them).
Choose a suitable data wrangling techniqueâ€”either data standardization or normalization. Execute the preferred normalization method and present the resulting data. (Normalization is the preferred approach for this problem.)
Share your insights regarding the application of the GroupBy() function for either data chunking or merging, and offer a recommendation based on your analysis.
  
  2. Data analysis

Perform descriptive statistical analysis on the data in the Sales and Unit columns. Utilize techniques such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for this analysis.
Identify the group with the highest sales and the group with the lowest sales based on the data provided.
Identify the group with the highest and lowest sales based on the data provided.
Generate weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports to document and present the results of the analysis conducted.
(Use suitable libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy for performing the analysis.)
 
  3. Data visualization

Use suitable data visualization libraries to construct a dashboard for the head of sales and marketing. The dashboard should encompass key parameters:
State-wise sales analysis for different demographic groups (kids, women, men, and seniors).
Group-wise sales analysis (Kids, Women, Men, and Seniors) across various states.
Time-of-the-day analysis: Identify peak and off-peak sales periods to facilitate strategic planning for S&M teams. This information aids in designing programs like hyper-personalization and Next Best Offers to enhance sales.
Ensure the visualization is clear and accessible for effective decision-making by the head of sales and marketing (S&M).
The dashboard must contain daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly charts.
(Any visualization library can be used for this purpose. However, since statistical analysis is being done, Seaborn is preferred.)
Include your recommendation and indicate why you are choosing the recommended visualization package.
