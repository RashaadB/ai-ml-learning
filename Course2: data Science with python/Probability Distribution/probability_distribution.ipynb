    "\n",
    "- Probability is a mathematical term for the likelihood of an event happening.\n",
    "- The chance of any event occurring is a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- It is used to anticipate risks and identify ways to manage such risks.\n",
    "- It is used to make predictions about future events based on their likelihood.\n",
    "- It is a powerful tool used to incorporate uncertainty in planning and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Flipping of a Coin: Possession and starting direction are determined at the beginning of a football game using a coin toss.\n",
    "    - The probability of getting the desired outcome while flipping a coin is 0.5 or 50%.\n",

    "- It is a type of variable whose value depends on the numerical outcomes of certain random events.\n",
