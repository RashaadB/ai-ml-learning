Project 1: Expense Tracker

# Personal Expense Tracker

A command-line Python application that helps users log, categorize, and track their personal expenses. This tool supports setting monthly budgets, viewing expenses, and saving/loading data to and from a file for persistent usage.



## Objectives

1. Enable users to add and manage daily expenses.
2. Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, etc.).
3. Set and track monthly spending budgets.
4. Support persistent storage via file handling (CSV).
5. Provide a user-friendly, interactive menu interface.

## Features

# Personal Expense Tracker


The Personal Expense Tracker allows users to:
- Enter expenses with a date, category, amount, and description
- Set a monthly budget and track spending against it
- Save and load expense data from a CSV file
- View all expenses in a formatted display
- Interact with the system via a simple terminal-based menu

## How the Program Works

When the script is run:
1. It attempts to load any previously saved expenses from a CSV file.
2. The user is prompted to enter their monthly budget.
3. A menu is displayed with options to:
   - Add an expense
   - View all expenses
   - Track the budget
   - Save expenses
   - Exit the program

Each menu option triggers the appropriate function, and all data is saved upon exiting the program.
