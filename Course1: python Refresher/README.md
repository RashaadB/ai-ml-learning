# üêç Python Refresher Folder

Welcome to my beginner-friendly Python refresher folder.  This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to guide you step-by-step through the foundational concepts of Python used in Ai/Ml ‚Äî from the absolute basics to more complex control structures and functional programming. After reviewing the ipynb files, there will be projects in the 'Course1:projects' folder. the projects will be saved as .py files instead of .ipynb so the files utilizes the terminal for input values

##  1. Python Fundamentals

Start here if you're completely new to Python.

- `fundamentals_py.ipynb`  
  Introduction to Python syntax, variables, data types, and simple expressions.

- `operators.ipynb`  
  Learn about arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators used in expressions.

- `chaining_comparison_operators.ipynb`  
  Explore how to combine multiple comparisons in a clean and readable way.

- `logical_operators.ipynb`  
  Deep dive into `and`, `or`, and `not` for building logical conditions.

- `short_circuit_evaluation.ipynb`  
  Understand how Python evaluates logical expressions efficiently.

- `ternary_operators.ipynb`  
  Learn concise one-line conditional expressions using ternary syntax.

---

## 2. Control Flow and Conditionals

Control how your code behaves based on conditions.

- `conditional_statements.ipynb`  
  Basics of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

- `for_else.ipynb`  
  Special use of `else` with `for` loops to handle non-breaking iteration.

- `while_loops.ipynb`  
  Looping with conditions ‚Äî run code until a condition becomes false.

- `for_loops.ipynb`  
  Iterate through sequences like lists, strings, and ranges.

- `infinite_loops.ipynb`  
  Learn how infinite loops work and how to break out of them properly.

- `nested_loops.ipynb`  
  Loop inside a loop ‚Äî useful for grids, matrices, and pattern logic.

---

## 3. Iterables and Built-in Functions

Understanding how to work with iterable objects and useful built-ins.

- `iterables.ipynb`  
  Explore objects that can be looped through like lists, tuples, and strings.

- `generators_lambdas_and_built_in_functions.ipynb`  
  Introduction to Python‚Äôs built-in functions, lambda expressions, and generators.

---

## 4. Functions in Python

Encapsulate logic into reusable blocks of code.

- `functions.ipynb`  
  Learn to define and use your own functions with parameters and return values.

- `arbitrary_arguments.ipynb`  
  Handle flexible function arguments with `*args` and `**kwargs`.

- `return_statement.ipynb`  
  Understand how to send results back from functions using `return`.

---

##  5. File and Error Handling

Read/write data and handle runtime problems gracefully.

- `file_handling.ipynb`  
  Open, read, write, and close files using Python's built-in file I/O.

- `error_handling.ipynb`  
  Catch and manage exceptions with `try`, `except`, and `finally`.

## Course1: projects folder

Visit the Course1: projects folder for 2 projects on what we've learned so far in python refresher section

- project 1 is a personal expense tracker
- project 2 is a Task Manager with user authentication

---
## How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo or open it in VS Code or JupyterLab.
2. Start with the notebooks in Course 1 and work your way down.
3. Each notebook includes explanations and hands-on code ‚Äî experiment and learn
