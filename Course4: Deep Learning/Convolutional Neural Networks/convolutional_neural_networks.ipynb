    "## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "- is a deep learning model specifically deisigned for visual data analysis, extracting features through convolution and pooling layers to achieve high leve pattern recgnition and classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "## advantages of CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "- they automatically detect essential features without human supervision.\n",
    "- Compared to feed forward neural networks, CNNs have higher accuracy in resolving image recognition problems \n",
    "- The results are more accurate than generic machine learning techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN applications\n",
    "- detection of tools in a factory, where cnn model can be trained to detect misplaced tools by factory workers\n",
    "- Detection of pulmonary fibrosis, where a cnn model can be fed a large dataset of a patient's lung images to identify any scarring in lung tissues. \n",
    "- widely used in the field of computer vision for face recognition, object detection, image classification, where it uses sets of filters to extract features from the image\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image data\n",
    "- the image consits of three dimensions: height, width, and channel.\n",
    "- the three channels, R,G,B represent the color of the image in a combination of red, green, and blue. \n",
    "- each channel, the values range from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the absence of that color and 255 represents the maximum intensity of that color. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In a cnn operation on the image data, convolution performs robust feature extraction, identifying and isolating various characteristics like edges, textures, and shapes within the image. CNN extracts all the necessary information that is helpful to train models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution Operation\n",
    "- convolution is a mathematical operation used in CNNs to extract features from input images. it involves sliding a filter (or kernel) over the image and computing the dot product of the filter with the local regions of the image.\n",
    "- A filter (or kernel) is a small matrix used to apply effects such as blurring, sharpening, and edge detection. The filter contains weights that are learned during the training process. \n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN Architecture \n",
    "- A CNN combines a backpropagation algorithm with multiple layers, inclduing convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. \n",
    "- It aims to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- basic architect layer in convolutional neural network: \n",
    "    - convolution layer\n",
    "    - pooling layer\n",
    "    - Fully connected layer\n",
    "    - Activation function\n",
    "    - output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Convolution Layer`: This layer is responsible for performing convolution operations on the given image and filter. The convolution operation is the sum of the product of the filter values with pixel values. \n",
    "    - The convolution operation is performed on each patch of the image using a filter, and a feature matrix (feature map) is created\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pooling layer`: Pooling layer, also called as downsampling layer, reduces the size of feature maps, which in turn makes computation faster. \n",
    "    - `Maximum pooling`: is pooling operation that calculates the maximum value for each patch of the feature map\n",
    "    - `Average pooling`: Calculates the average value for each patch of the feature map\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Fully Connected Layer`: It is a feed forward neural network and forms the last few layers in the neural network. Output from the final pooling or convolutional layer is flattened and then fed into the fully connected layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- `activation function`: the activation function calculates the weighted the weighted sum and adds bias to decide if a neuron should be activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Output layer`: the output layer in a CNN is reponsible for producing the final predictions or classifications based on the extracted features from the previous layers. It consists of one or more fully conected layers, follwed by an activation function such as softmax for classification tasks. The output layers weights are learned through backpropagation during training to minimize loss and improve prediction accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN architecture parameters\n",
    "- `Strides`: The movement of the processing window is controlled by the stride in CNN operations like convolution and max-pooling. It denotes the number of pixel shifts across the input matrix. This affects the output size and may have an impact on the computational effectiveness and amount of detail in the generated feature maps. \n",
    "    - example: if the stride is set to 1, the kernel moves horizontally and vertically by one pixel\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Padding`: it adds zeros to the input matrix symmetrically to make the shape of the output matrix the same as the input. It reduces image shrinkage and increases image analysis accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residual neural network (ResNet) is a convolutional neural network architecture widely used in computre vision tasks. \n",
    "- Residual connections, or skip connections, in ResNet facilitate direct pathways for gradient flow during training, helping to preserve the gradient through many layers and combat the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "- Residual connections copy the learned representations from a shallower model and add additional layers to establish identity mapping. \n",
    "- It supports the construction of neural networks with thousands of convolutional layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet Variant\n",
    "\n",
    "- ResNet50: it has 50 layers, which include 48 convolutional layers, one max-pool layer, and one average pool layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN filters\n",
    "- Filters (kernels) detect spatial patterns or features in an image, such as edges, arches, and diagonals, by detecting changes in the intensity values of an image. \n",
    "- the type of filter used affects the output produced after convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Horizontal sobel filter\n",
    "    - outline filter\n",

    "    - vertical sobel filter\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Horizontal sobel filter`: This filter is primarily used to detect horizontal edges in images. It emphasizes horizontal lines by changes in pixel intensity in the horizontal direction\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Vertical sobel filter`: This filter is used to detect vertical edges in images by highlighting vertical gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Blur filter`: it is responsible in smoothening the image, reducing noise and detail, which can be particularly useful in preprocessing steps to reduce model sensitivity to minor variations\n",
    "\n",
    "- `outline filter`: it is responsible for detecting the outline of objects in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pooling in CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pooling operation involves sliding a two dimensional filter over each spatial dimension of the feature map, reducing its spatial size while retaining significant featuers, it summarizes the features that lie within the region covered by the filter\n",
