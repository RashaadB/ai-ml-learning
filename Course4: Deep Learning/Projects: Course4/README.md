## Project 1
`deepLearning_tensorFlow_keras.ipynb`

## This project introduces an advanced approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. By leveraging the dataset, this project will classify images of bikes and cars into distinct categories. The goal is to apply computer vision techniques to classify vehicles based on their images, which could later be used in operational optimization and demand forecasting.

<!-- Develop a CNN-based image classification model that distinguishes between bikes and cars using the given image dataset. The CNN model will be implemented to classify images based on vehicle type, with potential extensions to classify other environmental features such as location and time of day. -->

## Task 1: Data preprocessing:

- Clean and preprocess the images from the Cars and Bikes Prediction Dataset
- Resize and normalize the images to be suitable for the CNN model input
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets

## Task 2: Building the CNN model:

- Design and implement a CNN using Keras or TensorFlow for image classification
- Use layers such as convolution, pooling, and dense layers to process the images
- Apply techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model robustness
